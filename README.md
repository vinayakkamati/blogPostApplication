## Reflection

This was a 2 week long project built during my training period at Mountblue Technolgies. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

The technologies implemented in this project are Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, JPA, Thymeleaf.
